exploratory-javascript-tests
============================

Some tests to help me remember the behavior of Javascript.

Tests can be viewed [here](http://pajtai.github.io/exploratory-javascript-tests/).

To use this repo, clone it and `npm install` for all the goodies.

Goodies include:

* `grunt server` - for livereload of js files.
* `grunt build` - to build to `dist` and push contents of `dist` to the `gh-pages` branch from the current branch.
